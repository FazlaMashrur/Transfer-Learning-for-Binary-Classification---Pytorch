How to organize the images in folder for classification

Let's assume your dataset in drive 'C:/'

You need to create folders as follows:

Train Dataset
C:/ Train Set/ Class 0: Put all Class 0 images in this folder
C:/ Train Set/ Class 1: Put all Class 1 images in this folder

In the Maincode, put the "C:/Train Set/" in the root. The code will automatically determine two class. 

Test DataSet
C:/ Test Set/ Class 0: Put all Class 0 images in this folder
C:/ Test Set/ Class 1: Put all Class 1 images in this folder

In the Maincode, put the "C:/Test Set/" in the root. The code will automatically determine two class.
